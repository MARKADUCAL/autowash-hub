# Employee Assignment Implementation for Booking Approval Workflow

## Overview

This implementation updates the booking approval workflow to require employee assignment before approval. Admins must now assign an employee to a booking before it can be marked as "Approved".

## Features Implemented

### 1. Employee Assignment Requirement

- **Before Approval**: Admins must select an employee from a dropdown
- **Required Field**: Employee selection is mandatory before approval
- **Validation**: Form validation ensures employee is selected

### 2. Database Changes

- Added `assigned_employee_id` column to `bookings` table
- Added foreign key constraint to `employees` table
- Added `updated_at` timestamp for tracking changes
- Added database index for performance

### 3. Backend API Updates

- New endpoint: `PUT /assign_employee_to_booking`
- Updated `GET /get_bookings_by_employee` endpoint
- Enhanced `PUT /update_booking_status` functionality

### 4. Frontend Updates

- New employee assignment dialog component
- Updated admin booking approval workflow
- Enhanced employee dashboard to show assigned bookings
- Improved user experience with loading states and error handling

## Database Migration

Run the following SQL commands to update your database:

```sql
-- Add assigned_employee_id column
ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN assigned_employee_id INT NULL;

-- Add foreign key constraint
ALTER TABLE bookings
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_bookings_employee
FOREIGN KEY (assigned_employee_id) REFERENCES employees(id)
ON DELETE SET NULL;

-- Add index for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_assigned_employee ON bookings(assigned_employee_id);

-- Add updated_at column
ALTER TABLE bookings ADD COLUMN updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
```

## API Endpoints

### Assign Employee to Booking

```
PUT /assign_employee_to_booking
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "booking_id": 123,
  "employee_id": 456
}
```

### Get Employee Bookings

```
GET /get_bookings_by_employee?employee_id=456
```

## Component Changes

### Admin Car Wash Booking Component

- **New Method**: `approveBooking()` now opens employee assignment dialog
- **Employee Loading**: Loads available employees for assignment
- **Integration**: Uses new `assignEmployeeToBooking` service method

### Employee Assignment Dialog

- **New Component**: `EmployeeAssignmentDialogComponent`
- **Features**:
  - Shows booking details
  - Employee selection dropdown
  - Validation for required selection
  - Assign & Approve button

### Employee Car Wash Booking Component

- **Updated**: Now shows only assigned bookings
- **Enhanced**: Loading states, error handling, empty states
- **Integration**: Uses `getBookingsByEmployee` service method

## Service Updates

### BookingService

- **New Method**: `assignEmployeeToBooking(bookingId, employeeId)`
- **New Method**: `getBookingsByEmployee(employeeId)`
- **Enhanced**: Better error handling and logging

## User Experience Improvements

### Admin Workflow

1. View pending bookings
2. Click "Approve" button
3. Select employee from dropdown
4. Click "Assign & Approve"
5. Booking is automatically approved and assigned

### Employee Experience

1. Login to employee dashboard
2. View assigned bookings
3. See booking details and status
4. Mark bookings as completed

## Error Handling

- **Validation**: Employee selection is required
- **Database**: Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity
- **API**: Comprehensive error messages and logging
- **Frontend**: User-friendly error states and retry options

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: Employee assignment requires admin privileges
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned records
- **Validation**: Server-side validation of all inputs
- **Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail of assignments

## Testing

### Backend Testing

- Test employee assignment endpoint
- Verify database constraints
- Test error scenarios

### Frontend Testing

- Test employee assignment dialog
- Verify form validation
- Test error states and loading

## Future Enhancements

1. **Notification System**: Email/SMS notifications to assigned employees
2. **Assignment History**: Track all employee assignments
3. **Workload Balancing**: Automatic employee assignment based on availability
4. **Mobile Support**: Mobile-friendly assignment interface
5. **Bulk Operations**: Assign multiple bookings at once

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Employee not found**: Verify employee exists in database
2. **Booking not found**: Check booking ID validity
3. **Permission denied**: Ensure user has admin privileges
4. **Database errors**: Check foreign key constraints

### Debug Steps

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify API endpoint responses
3. Check database constraints
4. Review server logs

- Angular 17+
- Angular Material
- PHP 8.0+
